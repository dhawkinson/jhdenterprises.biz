          <h4 className='about-title'>About</h4>
          <p className='about-content'>After years of trading employee hours for pay and benefits with limits on raises that might equal the rise in the cost of living (in a good year) and fighting the "old boy" network, we realized our efforts were not going to take us to the kind of freedom we sought. After much research we discovered a model for building wealth that allows us to determine our level of freedom in both setting the specifics of how we work and our level of compensation.</p>
          <p className='about-content'>This model is flexible enough that you can start small, keep your present job and build until you have the confidence and are energized enough to launch out and set your own limits. Or you can stay right where you are, work this as a sideline, and enhance your current earnings. That is your decision.</p>
          <p className='about-content'>Contact us if you are ready to take control of your future.</p>
